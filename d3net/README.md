# D3Net: Densely connected multidilated convolutional networks for dense prediction tasks

This is the official NNabla implementation of D3Net, densely connected multidilated convolutional networks for dense prediction tasks ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11844),)
which is accepted at CVPR 2021.

D3Net is demonstrated on the Music Source Separation and Semantic Segmentation tasks. Please follow the links below to explore inference code and training code:
